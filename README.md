Drupal Plugins
==============

Base building block for a scalable and extensible plug-in system for PHP components and application framework extensions. Includes discoveries.

This package is a **temporary** way to expose the D8 Plugin components along with some other utility classes. This repo will go away when/if the Drupal 8 core team creates a project with this in packagist.
